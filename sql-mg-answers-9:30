-- You're wandering through the wilderness of someone else's code, and you stumble across
-- the following queries that use subqueries. You think they'd be better as CTE's
-- Go ahead and re-write the queries to use CTE's

-- -- EXAMPLE CTE:
--Returns the customer IDâ€™s of ALL customers who have spent more money than $100 in their life.

WITH customer_totals AS (
  SELECT customer_id, 
         SUM(amount) as total
  FROM payment
  GROUP BY customer_id
)

SELECT customer_id, total 
FROM customer_totals 
WHERE total > 100;


--YOUR TURN:
-- Returns the average of the amount of stock each store has in their inventory. 
SELECT AVG(stock)
FROM (SELECT COUNT(inventory_id) as stock
	  FROM inventory
	  GROUP BY store_id) as store_stock;

WITH store_stock AS (SELECT COUNT(inventory_id) as stock
	  FROM inventory
	  GROUP BY store_id)

SELECT AVG(stock)
FROM store_stock;

	  
-- Returns the average customer lifetime spending, for each staff member.
-- HINT: you can work off the example
SELECT staff_id, AVG(total)
FROM (SELECT staff_id, SUM(amount) as total
	  FROM payment 
	  GROUP BY customer_id, staff_id) as customer_totals
GROUP BY staff_id;

WITH customer_totals AS (SELECT staff_id, SUM(amount) as total
	  FROM payment 
	  GROUP BY customer_id, staff_id)
SELECT staff_id, AVG(total)
FROM customer_totals

-- Returns the average rental rate for each genre of film.

-- Return all films that have the rating that is biggest category 
-- (ie. rating with the highest count of films)
SELECT title, rating

				FROM film
			   GROUP BY rating
			   ORDER BY COUNT(*)

			   GROUP BY rating
			   ORDER BY COUNT(*)
			   LIMIT 1)
